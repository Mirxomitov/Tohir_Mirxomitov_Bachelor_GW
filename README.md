# Intelligent Mini Robot-Electric Car for Environmental Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on the development of an intelligent mini robot-electric car designed for environmental analysis. The robot is equipped with:

- **Camera:** Captures real-time visual data for monitoring and analysis.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures distances and detects obstacles, enabling smooth navigation and collision avoidance.
- **Infrared Emitter:** Detects heat signatures or aids in low-light conditions to enhance its operational capabilities.

The robot leverages cutting-edge technologies in hardware and software to autonomously navigate its environment, collect data, and process it for meaningful insights. The aim is to create an efficient, scalable solution for environmental research, smart transportation systems, and automation tasks.

This repository contains the complete documentation, source code, and hardware integration guides for replicating and understanding the project.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous navigation and obstacle detection**
- **Environmental data collection and processing**
- **Modular design for easy upgrades and customizations**

## Repository Contents
